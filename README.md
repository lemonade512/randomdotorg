This is an interface written in python to get true random
numbers from random.org. This project is a work in progress
so use it wisely and make sure to follow all of the rules
posted at https://api.random.org/guidelines. Certain features
that are in the guidelines have not yet been implemented and
tested (like resetting exponential backoff at midnight).
